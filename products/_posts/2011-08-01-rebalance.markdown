It seems profoundly important that financial freedom is so accessible—just by following a set of basic principles, with discipline. At the same time, it’s profoundly sad that so many never do, simply because they are unaware. That’s why Makalu founder, Matt Henderson, wrote this book.

The problem with many books about investing is that they are too long and complex. The essential message that everyone should be investing gets lost in discussion of choices and optimization. Matt’s approach in this book is to present the core principles as concisely as possible—hopefully both motivating you, and convincing you to get started today.
