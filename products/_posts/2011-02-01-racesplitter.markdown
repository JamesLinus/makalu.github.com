In the past, organizers of sporting events wanting to hire a professional a timing service had to spend $1,500 and up. And coaches wanting a tool to provide their athletes with live standings during a race had to spend $500 and up. 

Believing there should be a better way, we created **RaceSplitter** — an iPhone app, supported by an online web service, that provides everything needed for "Do It Yourself" race timing, at a fraction of the price. Today, organizations and individuals from the United States to Norway, and in over 25 countries in between, are benefitting from Makalu's first commercial product. We couldn't be prouder!
