Makalu frequently works with Google to develop mapping applications for their internal and external projects. We developed an embedded map used online and on-event for the Oâ€™Reilly Where 2.0 conference, a map (published on the Google home page!) displaying the winners of the Doodle 4 Google contest, and a map and management application displaying companies using Google Apps.
