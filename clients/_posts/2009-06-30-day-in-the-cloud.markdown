On Wednesday, June 24th 2009, Google Apps and Virgin America invited the brave and the willing, the airborne and the earthbound to embark on the Day in the Cloud Challenge, the first online scavenger hunt played simultaneously in the air and, well, everywhere else.

Google chose Makalu to design, develop and operate the online game which anchored the ambitious campaign.
