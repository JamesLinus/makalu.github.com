Each June, more than 80,000 music fans descend on the Nürburgring, for four days of rock-n-roll mayhem at Germany's largest summer music festival — Rock-am-Ring.

Makalu designed, built and operated the Rock-am-Ring site, companion award-winning iPhone app, and backend content management system for Europe’s leading event promoter, Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur.
