Every year in June, more than 80,000 music fans descend on the Nürburgring, for four days of rock-n-roll mayhem at Germany’s largest summer music festival — Rock-am-Ring.

Makalu is designing, building and operating the 25th anniversary Rock-am-Ring site for Europe’s leading event promoter, Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur.
