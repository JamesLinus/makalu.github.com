In 2004, Scott Olsen and Ali Hamed asked each other, ”Why is it so hard to find a top real estate agent?” Through the company they founded, Agent Machine, they’ve since redefined the real estate experience—helping consumers, particularly of high-end real-estate, find and engage with the nation's very top agents.

Having helped Agent Machine dramatically increase customer conversion on their public-facing web properties, Makalu is currently working to help them design and develop an effective and efficient platform on which their network of agents transact.
