    <h1>What we do.</h1>
    <p class="hyphenate">
      <big>
        From strategy to design and development, we know what it takes to build successful products.
      </big>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some customers hire us for blue-sky projects, while others hire us to focus on a specific challenge. Google & Virgin America engaged us to design, build and operate an online game that promoted the values of both brands, and could be played at 39,000 feet. At the other end of the spectrum, Referral Exchange wanted us to redesign their landing pages, specifically targeting an increase in conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re comfortable integrating into your existing product team or working stand-alone.

      <p>
        Design is everything—how it looks, how it reads, how it engages, how it works. We love all aspects of product design, and have been practicing them for more than two decades.

        ChessDrop users enter their games while at tournaments, and so designing for mobile was a clear priority. From positioning of the player names, to game move interaction, to thumb-targeted placement of the forward/backward controls, the design and implementation of the user interface to work well in smartphone, tablet and desktop environments was a considerable challenge.

        Built using React and backed by Meteor, ChessDrop has a responsive and real-time interface that's crucial for an enjoyable playing experience.
