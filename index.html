    <h2>Why Makalu?</h2>
    <p>
      <big>
        Our work has been used by millions of people, copied by competitors, featured in the App Store, and has helped companies small and big find success.
      </big>
    </p>

    <p>
      To create a great product, you need a team with the highest level of skill and ability, able to adapt to the unique circumstances of your organization—and ultimately capable of delivering a product that brings you success. That’s us!
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re equally comfortable integrating into your existing product team, or working stand-alone.
