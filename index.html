    <h1>What we do.</h1>
    <p>
      <big>
        From strategy to design and development, we know what it takes to build successful products.
      </big>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some customers hire us for blue-sky projects, while others hire us to focus on a specific challenge. Google & Virgin America engaged us to design, build and operate an online game that promoted the values of both brands, and could be played at 39,000 feet. At the other end of the spectrum, ReferralExchange wanted us to redesign their landing pages, specifically targeting an increase in conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re comfortable integrating into your existing product team or working stand-alone.

      <h4>Product & UI/UX Design</h4>
      <p>
        Design is everything—how it looks, how it reads, how it engages, how it works. We love all aspects of product design, and have been practicing them for more than two decades.

      <h4>Mobile Applications</h4>
      <p>

      <h4>Web Apps with Rails</h4>
