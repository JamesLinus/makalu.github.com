      <h2>Why Makalu?</h2>
      <p>
        <big>
          Our work has been used by millions of people, featured in the App Store, and has helped companies small and big find success.
        </big>
      </p>

      <p>
        Many teams design and develop products. What differentiates Makalu is that we deliver results—every time. Need to signup a million users in your first year? We’ve done that. Need an engaging game that’s playable in the bandwidth-constrained environment of an airplane? We’ve done that. When the impact of a single-percent increase in landing-page conversion results in millions in additional revenue, we’ve increased it by <em>four</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We design and develop products—but what we <em>deliver</em> is results.

      <h2>What we do.</h2>
      <p>
        <big>From strategy to design and development, we know what it takes to build successful products.</big>
      </p>
      <p>
        We add the most value by being part of projects right from the start, but we’re also very effective in improving existing products. We’re comfortable integrating into your existing product team, or working stand-alone. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And when it comes to getting the thing built, here’s where we can help:

          Product & UI/UX Design
        </a>
        <div class="small">
          <p>Design is everything—how it looks, how it reads, how it engages, how it works. We love all aspects of product design, and have been practicing them for more than two decades.</p>
          <p>Some customers hire us for blue-sky projects, while others hire us to focus on a specific challenge. Google & Virgin America engaged us to design, build and operate an online game that promoted the values of both brands, and could be played at 39,000 feet. At the other end of the spectrum, Referral Exchange engaged us to redesign the company’s landing pages, specifically targeting an increase in conversion.</p>

          Mobile Applications
        </a>
        <div class="small">
          <p>We have years of experience building mobile apps, both as our own products, as well as for clients.</p>
          <p>Our iOS app, Rego, received critical acclaim when it launched in 2013 and was featured in the App Store in 127 countries. Our RaceSplitter iOS app, integrating with a back-end web service, has been used to time over a million participants in sports events in over 100 countries.</p>
          <p>Although we specialize in iOS, we have experience on Android as well. For the Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur, we engineered single, platform-specific iOS and Android codebases that, through configuration can deploy mobile apps serving each of the three MLK music festivals. To provide a consistent cross-platform user experience, we made extensive use of web-views, relying on platform-native technology where it made sense—for example, venue mapping.</p>

          <p>And we love staying abreast of the ever-changing landscape of development technologies. Soon after its public release we began using Facebook React for prototyping and to enhance our products. Our latest product, a personal chess database called ChessDrop, was built with React and uses Meteor for data storage and real-time sync. It was the perfect product context to apply this exciting new technology stack.</p>

          <p>Our Rails-based CMS for music festivals drives websites and apps receiving hundreds of thousands of requests during peak hours.</p>
