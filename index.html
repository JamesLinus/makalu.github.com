<section class="achievements">
  <p>We created a <strong>game-based marketing campaign</strong> for Google & Virgin America that executives from the advertising agency Ogilvy called, “the future of marketing.”</p>
  <p>We created a web-based service for Catalog Choice (now <a href="https://www.catalogchoice.org">TrustedID</a>) that signed up over a <strong>million members</strong> in less than a year.</p>
  <p>We created an iPhone app—<a href="http://regoapp.com">Rego</a>—that Apple liked so much they <strong>featured it on the App Store home screen</strong> in 127 countries. (That’s hitting the jackpot.)</p>
  <p>By redesigning their landing pages, we <strong>increased the customer conversion rate</strong> of million-dollar-home meta-broker <a href="highendagents.com">Highend Agents</a> from 2% to 8%.</p>
  <p>We created an iPhone app—<a href="http://racesplitter.com">RaceSplitter</a>—that’s been used to time nearly <strong>a million sport participants</strong> in events in over 80 countries.</p>
  <p>We designed the user interface that helped Jawaker become the middle east’s largest online card-based gaming platform.</p>
  <p>We built the digital products that helped Germany’s Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur to become the world’s third largest entertainment agency.</p>

  <h2>“When we talk about Makalu here at Google, we always say that it’s more like working with other Googlers (an internal team) than an external vendor.”</h2>
  <p>That's a quote from Andrew Chang, a former product marketing manager at Google, and it's something our customers often tell us.</p>
  <p>Whether we’re hired to consult on strategy, to provide targeted design or to take a product all the way through development, our customers benefit from the full attention of our A-Team—because at Makalu, that’s the only team.</p>
