  	<h1>Why you should hire us</h1>
  	<p>
  	  <big>
  	  	Ask Gordon Ramsay, and he’ll tell you straight up—the best dishes are made from a few key ingredients that work perfectly together. So are the best teams.
  	  </big>
  	 </p>

  <p>
  	Ours includes just three people. Alex does design and front-end development, Justin is a Rails and iOS developer, and Matt does everything in-between—from leading the team, to product guidance, to copy writing, to customer support.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rather than growing to become an “agency”, the flexibility in just remaining a “team” has given us access to some unique opportunities, and allowed us to accomplish really big things for brands like Google, Virgin America and Catalog Choice.
  </p>
  <p>
		What’s special about Makalu is our cross-discipline capabilities—our designer is highly skilled in development, while our developer is highly skilled in design. This combination allows us to extend “design” deeply into the holistic domain of “how it works”—which differentiates products that look nice, from those that actually deliver results.
  </p>
  <p>
		For the past few years, we’ve worked almost exclusively for a German concert promoter, Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur, helping them go from startup to become the world’s fifth largest promoter—and recently getting acquired by the world’s largest, Live Nation.
  </p>
  <p>
		With that acquisition, we’re looking for our next challenge. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  We’re experienced in working alone or integrating into existing teams, and we know how to ensure that working remotely doesn’t compromise results. We’re adaptable and enjoyable to work with, and, above all, <strong>you’ll be amazed at the results we can deliver.</strong>
