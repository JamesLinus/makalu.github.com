  	<h1>Why you should hire us</h1>
  	<p>
  	  <big>
  	  	Ask Gordon Ramsay, and he’ll tell you straight up—the best dishes are made from a few key ingredients that work perfectly together. So are the best teams.
  	  </big>
  	 </p>
  </header>

  <p>
  	Ours includes just three people. Alex does design, front-end development and Rails development, Justin is a Rails and iOS developer, and Matt does everything in-between—from managing the team, to guiding product, to copy writing, to customer support.
  </p>
  <p>
  	Rather than growing to become an “agency”, the flexibility in just remaining a “team” has allowed us to participate in some unique opportunities, and accomplish some really big things for brands like Google, Virgin America and Catalog Choice.
  </p>
  <p>
  	For Catalog Choice, we created the original site that signed up one million users in its first year. For Google and Virgin America, we created the “Day in the Cloud” online game, anchoring the campaign that Ogilvy executives called, “an example of the future of marketing”. And our very own iOS app, Rego, was featured on the App Store home page in 127 countries!
  </p>
  <p>
		What’s special about Makalu is our cross-discipline capabilities—our designer is highly skilled in development, while our developer is highly skilled in design. This combination allows us to extend “design” deeply into the domain of “how it works”—differentiating products that look nice, from those that deliver results.
  </p>
  <p>
		For the past decade—and almost exclusively for the past three years—we’ve worked for a German concert promoter, Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur, helping them go from startup to become the world’s fifth largest promoter—and recently getting acquired by the world’s largest, Live Nation.
  </p>
  <p>
		With that acquisition, we’re looking for our next challenge. 
	</p>
  <p>
		We’re experienced in working alone and integrating into existing teams, and we know how to ensure that working remotely is a net benefit. And while we love project work, ideally we’d like an opportunity to join an organization for the long-term, working like an external extension of an internal team, with the goal (if possible) of reserving one day per week for free exploration and working on our own apps. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  We’re friendly, flexible and easy to work with, and, above all, you’ll be amazed at the results we’ll deliver. So if you’re looking for a great little team, <a href="/#contact">we’re just a click away!</a>
