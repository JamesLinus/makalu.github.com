I’ve been reading the book, “Why we get fat” by Gary Taubes. If you’re interested in understanding the relationship between eating and getting fat, then you must read the book. It could change your life.

The revelation of the book is that some common dietary beliefs are, as demonstrated by science & biology, complete inverted. And that got me thinking about possible parallels in other areas, such as productivity.

### Turning what we thought, upside down.

In a nutshell, the message of the book is that fat is accumulated in the body through a meticulous regulation system controlled by insulin. We get fat when this regulation system is thrown off balance, which happens when we consume sugars — both simple (sweets), and complex (breads, pastas, starchy vegetables like potatoes, etc.)

(As an aside, the book provides the scientific basis from which the Paleo diet arose. I’ve been on the Paleo diet for 1.5 years, and have never been leaner, stronger or felt better in my life.)

What’s truly striking in the book, is the scientific demonstration of the complete inversion of a common belief that we get fat because we overeat:

We do not get fat because we overeat; we overeat because we’re getting fat.
Eating sugars and carbs causes our insulin system to promote the accumulation of fat in our bodies, which, in turn, drives us to eat more. It’s not the number of calories; it’s the source. This is a very powerful and important notion.
