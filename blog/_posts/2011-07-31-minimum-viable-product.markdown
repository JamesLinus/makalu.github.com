teaser: Right now we're discussing minimum viable products.
excerpt: Makalu is a small team of six people who, having provided client design and development services for nearly a decade, released its first own product in 2011 — “RaceSplitter,” an application for the iPhone, that changes how organizers of sporting events time their races. Our aim for the version 1.0 release of RaceSplitter was to deliver a “minimum viable product”. During the process, we discovered that our idea of a MVP differs somewhat from that of others.

Makalu is a small team of six people who, having provided client design and development services for nearly a decade, released its first own product in 2011 — “RaceSplitter,” an application for the iPhone, that changes how organizers of sporting events time their races.

Our aim for the version 1.0 release of RaceSplitter was to deliver a “minimum viable product”. During the process, we discovered that our idea of a MVP differs somewhat from that of others.

**It’s not just what you build, it’s also how you build it.**

Any organization that sets out to bring a product to market must decide what to build, and on that point it’s common to hear people speak of the “minimum viable product”. For Makalu, the MVP contains the minimal functionality to deliver the core of the product’s value proposition. This should not be confused, however, with the minimal *implementation* of this minimal functionality. 

And this is where many companies get it wrong. 

By shipping a minimal *implementation* of the minimal functionality, they overlook the criticality of the user experience in the success of any product — particularly a 1.0.

After 200 man-hours of effort, we had a version of RaceSplitter which was minimally functional, in that it implemented all of the functionality we considered core to the product. But it wasn’t until we’d invested an additional 400 hours that we felt we had a minimum viable product — i.e. a product that delivered the core functionality, within a friction-free experience that users would *love*, and what to tell others about. 

That’s right — fully *two thirds* of the development cost of the product went into perfecting the user experience. 

Here’s a number of examples:

1. REDUCING INTERFACE COMPLEXITY. The user interaction model went through three fundamental revisions; each revision reducing one complete level of interface hierarchy. The result was an interface in which people can use the essential features of the app with far few clicks.

2. REDUCING CHOICES THE USER HAS TO MAKE. The interaction of the timing model — i.e. how the user records the time a racer passes by — went through several iterations until one was found that supported three modes of timing simultaneously: (1) single racer timing, (2) group timing (giving the same time to multiple racers), and (3) sub-group timing (giving the same time to a subset of a selected group of racers). By supporting all timing scenarious in a single interaction model, we avoid one user choice: “Which mode should I select?”

3. REMOVING FRICTION. When changing a race from one start mode to another — e.g. from interval start to mass start — we inform the user what effect that’s going to have on the ordering of any racers already added to the start list (giving them the chance to cancel the change).

**Iterate with high-fidelity prototypes.**

These kinds of user experience details are achieved through an iterative process of testing high-fidelity (working) prototypes of the application, and diligently seeking to remove all points of interface friction. 

You can identify friction by watching someone use the product for the first time, without a manual. When you ask them to create and run a race, and observe a smooth tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-done, you know you’re on the right path. But when you see tap-tap...hmmm...tap...oops...tap — you know further thinking and refinements are needed.

**Costly, but worth it.**

This process is costly. On the other hand, we’re convinced that in the long term, it’s the best path to creating successful products — meaning, products that *succeed* in the market.

In the case of RaceSplitter, our initial users *loved* the product. In fact, due to the enthusiasm of a single early adopter in Norway, we’ve ended up selling nearly as many copies in that one small country as we have in the United States. 

Although there are many areas in which RaceSplitter can (and will) be improved, the most frequent feedback we received was along the lines of, “Wow — it’s so easy to use! I handed RaceSplitter to my friend before the race, and with no instruction he timed the entire event, edited a couple mis-entries, and published the results online.”

**It’s your choice.**

Shipping the minimal implementation of the minimum viable product increases the chance that your first users will think, “Nice idea. I’ll try to remember to check back someday.” — never to return.

Perfect execution of the minimal viable product in a 1.0 release,  on the other hand, increases the chances that your initial users will be so delighted that they’ll want to tell others, and that organic promotion can be critical to a product’s success.
