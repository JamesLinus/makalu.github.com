We’re looking to grow our team with someone who loves design.

#### WHO WE ARE

Makalu Interactive is a small company that provides its clients with high quality design, development and consulting services. We regularly get to work on interesting projects for great companies like Google, YouTube, Virgin America and O’Reilly.

Recently, we’ve begun to produce our own products. Our long term goal is to sustain ourselves exclusively through products.

Our office is on the Mediterranean sea, in beautiful Marbella, Spain.

#### WHAT WE’RE LIKE

Quality of life is very important. At the end of our careers, we want look back on years of doing great work, creating real value, solving important problems, delighting people, and feeling we’ve done our best and have enjoyed ourselves. We’re very serious about that.

We believe if those are the priorities, everything else will fall into place. So far everything has.

#### WHO WE’RE LOOKING FOR

You’re someone who loves to design product interfaces, and has experience with web and mobile products. Although you feel you still have so much to learn, you know inside you’re really good at what you do.

Ideally, you like to build what you design, and are proficient in HTML and CSS (maybe even JavaScript.) You’re not afraid of technology.

You enjoy studying well designed products, like those from Apple. You like to think about the process of design, and try to figure out how to *consistently* produce great design.

Characteristics that are likely important to you are humility, honesty, objectivity and authenticity.

#### ABOUT THE JOB

We’d love to hire someone who can work in our office. But we’re also fine with remote working. If you’re based in Europe, at least we’d be in the same time zone.

Although this is a full time position, we’ll probably want to start with a couple of pilot projects, to make sure we’re right for each other.

#### HOW TO APPLY

Along with your CV, send a letter to matt at makaluinc.com explaining why you’re interested in the position.
