      <h3>Day in the Cloud</h3>
      <p>
        One of our proudest moments was hearing Ogilvy executives refer to the game we created that anchored the Google & Virgin America “Day in the Cloud” campaign as, “An example of the future of marketing.” Back when Flash was the default interactive technology, we built this game in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, making it playable in the bandwidth contrained environment of airplane wifi at 30,000 feet.
