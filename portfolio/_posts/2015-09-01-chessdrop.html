    ChessDrop users enter their games while at tournaments, and so designing for mobile was a clear priority. From positioning of the player names, to game move interaction, to thumb-targeted placement of the forward/backward controls, the design and implementation of the user interface to work well in smartphone, tablet and desktop environments was a considerable challenge.

    Built using React and backed by Meteor, ChessDrop has a responsive and real-time interface that's crucial for an enjoyable playing experience.
