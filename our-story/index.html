  	Makalu was founded in 2005 by American Matt Henderson and Finn Alex Bendiken. Living in southern Spain after having built a successful aerospace software company in Germany, Matt met Alex after discovering that the winner of the Wil Shipley blog redesign contest lived just down the road in Marbella. With a shared passion for design and everything internet-related, the two set off to build digital products that would delight.

  <p>
  	The small team worked in relative obscurity until, in 2006, Alex entered, and won, a redesign contest for what was then the world’s largest tech news website, Slashdot.
  </p>
  <p>
		In the wake of that exposure, Makalu was contacted by a group of environmentalists from New York and Berkeley, California, who put their trust in the young team, which had grown to include a Ruby on Rails developer, and hired them to design and build the original website for Catalog Choice. In its first year, Catalog Choice saw an unheard of conversion rate of nearly 70%, and signed up over one million users.

  </p>
  <p>
		The success of Catalog Choice led to a contact from the marketing department at Google, who were planning a cross-marketing campaign with Virgin America. The partners hired Makalu to design, develop and operate an online game that would be played during the first 24 hours of Virgin’s launch of in-flight wifi across their entire US fleet. Exectives at Ogilvy later called the tremendously successful event, “a glimpse at the future of marketing.”

  </p>
  <p>
		From there, the small Makalu team went on to collaborate with the US Navy on an educational platform for their international outreach program, designed and developed a web-based game for the middle-east largest online card-based gaming platform, doubled the conversion rate for a California high-end properties agent referal network, and designed the user interfaces for a number of venture-funded silicon valley start-ups.
  </p>
  <p>
		The team then received an opportunity to work exclusively for Germany’s largest entertainment promoter, and over the next years, having expanded our capabilities to include mobile app development, proceeded to design, develop and operated the digital products—including a network of web, iPhone and Android applications—that led to Marek Lieberberg Konzertagentur (MLK) to become the world’s fifth largest promoter.
	</p>
	<p>
		During those years, Makalu dedicated some time to the development of its own products, including RaceSplitter, an iOS app that has been used to time over one million participants in sports events around the world, and Rego, a geo-location bookmarking app that Apple featured on the home page of its App Store in 127 countries (that’s like hitting the lottery!)
	</p>
	<p>
		In August of 2015, MLK was acquired by Live Nation, the world’s largest promoter, with plans to merge MLK’s digital presence into their own, forming Live Nation Germany.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that acquisition done, Makalu is again availalbe to take on new challenges and continue living our dream in the design and development of digital products that delight and bring success to our customers. If you have a project in mind, we’d love to talk with you.
