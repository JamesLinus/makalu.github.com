  	  	Celebrating 10 years, here’s a behind the scenes look of how we ended up where we are today.

  	Makalu was founded in 2005 by American Matt Henderson and Finn Alex Bendiken. Having built a successful aerospace software company in Germany, Matt met Alex after discovering that the winner of the Wil Shipley blog redesign contest lived just down the road in Marbella, Spain. With a shared passion for design and everything internet-related, the two set off to build digital products that would deliver results, with delight.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The small team worked in relative obscurity until, in 2006, Alex entered, and won, a redesign contest for what was then the world’s largest tech news website, Slashdot.
  </p>
  <p>
		In the wake of that exposure, Makalu was approached by a group of environmentalists from New York and Berkeley, who put their trust in the young team to design and build the original website for Catalog Choice. In its first year, Catalog Choice experienced periods of unheard-of conversion rates reaching 70%, signed up over one million users and received coverage on all major networks.

  <p>
		The success of Catalog Choice led to an opportunity with Google, who were planning a cross-marketing campaign with Virgin America. The partners hired Makalu to design, develop and operate an online game that would be played during the first 24 hours of Virgin’s launch of in-flight wifi across their entire American fleet.

	<p>The requirement to host the product in Google App Engine led to Justin joining our team, as a specialist in the Python language. Fortunately for us, he turned out to be quite the polymath—skilled in Python, Rails, Objective-C and, rare for a programmer, design!</p>
	<p>The Google/Virgin America “Day in the Cloud” campaign was one of our proudest moments, with executives at Ogilvy calling the tremendously successful event, “a glimpse at the future of marketing.”

		From there, the small Makalu team went on to collaborate with the US Navy on an international educational platform, designed and developed a web-based game for the largest online gaming platform in the middle-east, doubled the conversion rate for a California high-end properties agent referal network, and designed the user interfaces for a number of venture-funded silicon valley start-ups.
  </p>
  <p>
		The team later received an opportunity to work exclusively for the German concert promoter, Marek Lieberberg. Expanding our capabilities to include mobile app development, we designed, developed and operated the digital products that led to MLK to grow from start-up to become the world’s fifth largest entertainment promoter.
	</p>
	<p>
		During those years, Makalu dedicated some time to the development of its own products, including RaceSplitter, an iOS app that has been used to time over one million participants in sports events around the world, and Rego, a geo-location bookmarking app that Apple featured on the home page of its App Store in 127 countries—that’s like winning the lottery!
	</p>
	<p>
		In August of 2015, MLK was acquired by Live Nation, the world’s largest promoter, with plans to merge MLK’s digital presence into their own, forming Live Nation Germany.
	</p>
	<p>
		With that acquisition done, Makalu is again available to take on new challenges. If you have a project in mind, we’d love to talk with you.
